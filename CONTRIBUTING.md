# Contributing guidelines

You are welcome to contribute to egui via discussions, issues, pull requests and by publishing egui integrations.

## Discussion

You can ask questions, share screenshots and more at GitHub Discussions: https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions

There is also an egui channel on the Embark discord at <https://discord.gg/vY8ZGS292W> (NOTE: I work at [Embark](https://www.embark-studios.com/), but egui is my hobby project).

## Filing an issue

Issues are for bug reports and feature requests. Issues are not for asking questions (use [Discussions](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions) for that).

Always make sure there is not already a similar issue to the one you are creating.

If you are filing a bug, please provide a way to reproduce it.

## Making a PR

Always file an issue (or find an existing one) and get feedback before you start working on a non-trivial pull request!

## Creating an integration for egui

If you make an integration for egui for some engine or renderer, please share it with the world!
I will add a link to it from the egui README.md so others can easily find it.
